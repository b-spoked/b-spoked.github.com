<h2>Blood Sugar Levels</h2>
<p>Having had diabetes for the last 25+ years it has really done my head in that I still need to write my blood sugar levels</p>


<h2><a href="app.whatwewanna.co.nz">What We Wanna</a></h2>
<p>I guess like may parents I am always keen to find new places, and rediscover some old ones, to take the kids for some gool old fun.</p>

<h3>Aims:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Simple:</strong> a clean UI that gives you what you need. It wasn't the idea to have users tied to the app but rather used as a quick reference.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Easy to find:</strong> we show you the notes in you area and how close they are to you.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Easy to add:</strong> if you find something new you are willing to share just add it.</p></li>
</ul>
