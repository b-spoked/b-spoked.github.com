    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few years there has been ever increasing talk about phone apps, especially with the iPhone app store, and it seems they are often talked about in
almost mythical terms - like an app is going to create world peace or solve world hunger.</p>


<p>My parents, probably along with many in their generation, have recently entered the world of smart phones and apps with gusto. Its cool to watch them get excited over all of these apps
and install them, get frustrated, keep the gems they find and uninstall the others (OK so I try and make sure they get rid of the ones they don't use :)).</p>


<p><strong>So what is the big deal then?</strong> well to me the big deal is the convenience and portability - your phone is never to far from you and therefore neither are apps that you have installed on it.
Being able to track your run or ride and look at it afterward, or do a bit of reading while you are delayed or check details of an event with out having to carry a bunch of paper with you.</p>


<p>In the coming years <strong>as the pure novelty of apps wears off you will see a much higher quality and consistency of app</strong> in regards to both use and content. Because more and more the same will happen with apps as did with the web -  remember when
there was a glut of those websites with flashing titles and buttons all over the show? </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you think about having an app developed there are options about how the app can be developed that can be worth considering before you jump in.</p>


<p>Having created apps both ways listed below there are definitely benefits to each. For me personally my preference is web apps because I can more easily
control the development and updating of the application - but in saying that there are many applications that are not suited to the web application approach.</p>




<h3>Native Apps</h3>


<p>Native apps are were you create the app using the devices native development language which differ on the iPhone, Android and other devices.</p>


<ul>
<li>Use full complement of native functions such as camera, accelerometer, address book ...</li>
<li>You can use storage on the phone for any photos/files.</li>
<li>The app will run faster.</li>
<li>App store approval process can hinder - while it helps monitor the quality it also can causes big headaches when rapidly developing new functionality.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Web Apps</h3>


<p>With web technologies getting far richer there aren't many things that you can't do these days.</p>


<ul>
<li>Create the app once for all platforms - you are targeting the phones browser so you can get greater coverage with one version of your app.</li>
<li>Quicker and easier to update - you can very quickly publish changes and fixes to your app as they aren't held up by app stores.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Other options</h3>


<p>There are always other options :) With phone apps you can create a web app and then using certain tools convert it to a native app.
This can help with the issue of creating apps that work on multiple devices - solving this issue can be a blessing depending on the audience of your app and allocated budget.</p>




<p><strong>If you want to geek out here is a good video on Native vs Web apps (its very long).</strong></p>
