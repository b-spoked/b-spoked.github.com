    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>My Wife</strong> - she keeps me on an even keel and is beautiful. What more could you ask for? She does insist that the dirty old pirate Johnny Depp is actually who she planned to marry :)<p>
<p><strong>My Kids</strong> - crazy and fun - crazy fun maybe :)<p>
<p><strong>My Mates</strong> - they get me out on my bike and together we are like a gang of kids again. Skids and wheelies are still cool.<p>
<p><strong>My Peers</strong> - coders / hackers / engineers - what ever you call them they are an awsome bunch really. A very giving group that achieve amazing things and more often than not let others benefit for free. Keep up the good work!<p>
