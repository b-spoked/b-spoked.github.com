    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are considering building aor having an app created for you here are a couple of pointers of what you should think about before getting stuck in.</p>




<p>I have been dealing with a client recently that started their app project with great gusto and a 'it needs to be built yesterday'
attitude that is very common. I was to build the UI for them using thier existing app as a base - now that we have gone passed thier imposed deadline of having the app 'done'.
I gave them a call to see how it was all going - well it seemed to be comming un-stuck at the seams as they batteled to understand what they are building.</p>


<p>So what questions should they have thought while they built thier app?</p>




<h3>Who is your app for?<h3>
<p>An obvious question but the answer can often be tainted by what you believe people want or should want from you app.</p>
<p>In the instance above the app was to be built with a friendly user interface to access environmental monitoring data.
True to form the first customer just wanted access to the raw data, but this is not to say in the future other clients will
want that fancy user interface.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>What platforms will you target?</h3>
<p>Obvioulsy this will be somewhat answered when you know who your creating your app for. These days you will often
see apps created for both the iPhone and Andriod - but who are your users. In one instance it turned out that while
many of the clients aspired to own an iPhone the phones thier work provided were in-fact Blackberries.</p>

<h3>Will it continue?</h3>
<p>Is this a one-off app that will be put out but you don't intend to upgrade or extends over time?</p>
