    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been dealing with a client recently that started their app project with great gusto and a 'it needs to be done yesterday'
attitude that is very common. I was to build the UI for them using thier existing app as a base - now that we have gone passed thier imposed deadline of having the app 'done'.
I gave them a call to see how it was all going - well it seemed to be comming un-stuck at the seams! </p>
