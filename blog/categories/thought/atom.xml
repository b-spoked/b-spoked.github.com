    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Come on app developers - just because you can doesn't mean that you should.<p>
<p>I was having a good discussion with some of the people I do some work with at
a local design agency and we were talking about the huge number of applications that are available to us. We then started listing off some of the absolute clangers
we had installed on our phone - and then promptly un-installed.</p>
<p>While it is great to see the explosion in the area of app development so many of them are reeking of rip-off or 'i wonder if i can turn a quick dollar' type apps.
So come on people - have some pride and don't create crap.</p>
